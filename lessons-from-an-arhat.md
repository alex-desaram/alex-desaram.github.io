# Lessons from an Arhat《第六十尊 金山觉意尊者》
*A quiet moment at Baoguang Temple.*

When I visited 宝光寺 (_Bǎogūang Sì_) – Baoguang Temple in 新都区 (_Xīndū_ _Qū_) – Xindu, I took part in an old tradition: selecting an arhat whose presence I felt drawn to, then counting an auspicious number—**21**, the age I turn this year—forward to find my destined guide.

That arhat was 第六十尊 金山觉意尊者 (*Dì liù shí zūn Jīnshān Juéyì Zūnzhě*) – Jueyi, the 60th arhat.

The moment felt quiet but charged.  
The following reflection came after sitting with that stillness.  
These words are mine– *but the lesson belongs to something older.*

*Incense hanging in the stillness.*

## 《第六十尊 金山觉意尊者》

二十一岁，远行在外，心未乱，志初成。

行至宝光寺，随缘一掷，得尊者觉意。

金山不言，觉意不动。

> 尊者指我曰：“你已知世界之繁，你将识自身之简。”

愿我不为喧嚣所动，
不为聪明所傲，
不为沉静所沉，
不为路径所困。

愿我守心之光，修意之清。
愿我所建有根，所爱有魂， 所行有意。

金山在望。觉意已生。
愿我登峰，不忘初心。

## Lessons from an Arhat 

At twenty-one, far from home—
my heart was steady, my path just beginning.

At Baoguang Temple, I cast my lot—
and received the Venerable *Jueyi*.

The Golden Mountain said nothing.
*Jueyi* did not move.

The arhat looked at me and said:
> “You’ve learned the noise of this world.
> Now you must learn your own silence.”

May I remain unmoved by clamor,
unimpressed by cleverness,
not lost in stillness,
not trapped by any single path.

May I guard my inner light
and keep my mind clear.
May what I build take root,
what I love have soul,
what I do have meaning.

The Golden Mountain awaits.
*Jueyi* stirs.
May I climb—
and never forget where I began.

### Original Verse from the 60th Arhat – Venerable Jueyi 《金山覺意尊者》

> 金山覺意尊者，為佛陀弟子。  
> 尊者常在佛陀身邊聆聽妙法，有如佛祖般的覺悟，  
> 撇棄人世間的一切煩惱，專意修習佛法，  
> 遵守佛祖教導，終成阿羅漢果。

> 揚眉朗笑太千，大千世界有洞天，  
> 功名利想君收束，著力搖船舉岸邊。

**Rough translation:**

> The Golden Mountain Arhat, *Jueyi*, was a disciple of the Buddha.  
> He remained near the Buddha, always listening to the Dharma,  
> and awakened with a clarity like that of the great teachers, 
> casting off worldly troubles and cultivating with pure focus.  
> Following the Buddha’s teaching, he ultimately attained Nirvana.

> With lifted brows and a radiant smile, he sees the vast world clearly.  
> Glory and gain—let them pass.  
> Steer your boat with care, and reach the other shore.

## Final Note

It’s easy to think of spirituality as something abstract. But standing there, with incense in the air, walking among the 500 arhats, I felt something tangible: a quiet invitation to reflect. 
> Not to do more. But to _see more_— by doing less.
